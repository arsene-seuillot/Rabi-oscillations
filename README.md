# Rabi-oscillations
Python animation of the Rabi oscillations of a two-level system on the Bloch sphere.

You can choose the detuning and observe the effective magnetic field vector on the Bloch sphere. You will see the precession movement of the state, and when the effective magnetic field is in the $XY$ plane, you can observe the Rabi oscillations between the poles.
